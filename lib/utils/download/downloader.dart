    // consider the async priority order in Dart as follows:
    //
    //    1. Sync  Task                     > Synchronous code, executes first
    //
    //    2. Micro Task                     > high priority async code, executes after sync code
    //                                      usually for things like updating app state, created via
    //                                      `ScheduleMicrotask` / `Completer` / etc.
    //
    //    3. Macro Task / Event Loop Task   > low priority async code, executes after microtasks
    //                                      usually for things like I/O & http requests, created via
    //                                     `Future` / `Stream` / etc.
    //
    // NOTE: A Completer.sync() is essentially a task that is sent to the top of the microtask
    // queue, a.k.a an async task  executed as soon as possible (potentially even synchronously).
